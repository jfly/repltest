# Development

We provide a `nix` powered devshell, which you can enter with `nix develop`.

Once you're in the devshell, try running the demo:

```console
python examples/demo.py
```

# Testing

Run the tests:

```console
pytest
```

Note: all of the examples in [./examples/]()./examples/) are tested with
`repltest` itself!
